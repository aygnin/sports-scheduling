# Scheduling for OUA Women’s Volleyball

This program schedules the OUA Women’s Volleyball 2024-2025 season, which involves 15 teams playing 20 games each. The goal was to minimize the sum of differences between home and away games for each team, as well as the sum of travel distances for each team. This was represented in the form of a bi-objective integer program and solved using the ε-constrained method.
